What is MBIST?
MBIST stands for Memory Built-In Self-Test. It is on-chip hardware that tests embedded memories like SRAMs without using heavy external test patterns. Instead of the tester controlling every read and write, MBIST generates and checks patterns internally.

Why MBIST is needed

Modern SoCs contain hundreds of memories. Testing them from outside:

Increases test time

Requires large tester memory

Misses at-speed faults

MBIST solves this by testing memories inside the chip, at real operating speed, with minimal tester interaction.

Advantages of MBIST

Reduces test time and test cost

Simplifies external test programs

Supports at-speed testing

Detects common memory faults like stuck-at, transition, coupling, and retention faults

Supports memory repair using spare rows or columns

Reusable IP across projects

The only drawback is small area overhead, which is acceptable.

MBIST Architecture (core idea)

MBIST has three main blocks:

MBIST Controller

MBIST Collar (Wrapper)

Optional JTAG TAP

MBIST Collar

The collar is placed closest to the memory.

Its job is to:

Execute march elements at memory speed

Directly control memory signals

Collect pass/fail, diagnostic, and repair data

Each memory usually has its own collar.

MBIST Controller

The controller is the brain.

It:

Stores and sequences test algorithms

Sends march commands to collars

Collects results from all collars

Handles modes like RUNBIST and retention test

Processes repair data if redundancy is present

One controller can control multiple collars.

JTAG TAP (optional)

The TAP allows:

External control of MBIST through JTAG

Starting and stopping tests

Reading status and debug information

This makes MBIST compatible with standard test flows.

How MBIST works (simple flow)

Tester or SoC enables MBIST

Controller selects an algorithm

Collar applies read/write operations to memory

Results are checked and collected

Pass/fail and repair data are reported

One-line conclusion

MBIST is a fast, reliable, and scalable way to test on-chip memories with minimal external effort.
